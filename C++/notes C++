-Requirements to run simulator
add gnuplot files to linker/c++ additional include directories
exclude example.cc from build


-Things to do
Test limits of roundoff error for variable checking
Figure out shattering (secondary splitting)
Recenter center of mass individually for each phase space
Figure out data containment
Figure out how to recombine after shattering
Figure out how to have identical evolution of shattered spaces vs. normal space
Figure out the mystery 2000 multiplier
Figure out decimal precision (VzC after recombination should be 0)
Implement multithreading

		Math Conversion
sigmaZ = hWidth;	the hWidth along the z axis
sigmaVz = hHeight;	the hHeight along the Vz axis
zetaZ = VzIntDist;	the distance between the two Vz intercepts				//I think since it is between z (distance) and Vz(relative difference in velocity)
tau = zIntDist;		the distance between the two z intercepts				//Its important to write z and Vz, instead of x and y
a = chirp;			the chirp. chirp = slope
b = b;				the relationship between the chirp, zIntDist, and VzIntDist. (b=a(tau/zeta)^2)
z = dist;			the distance from the origin-from the center of mass
Vz = vel;			the difference in velocity from center of mass

Distance/Velocity/Time Conversions
Relativistic velocity
v=164.35								uM/ps
t=dist/v								ps = uM/(uM/ps)	

Kv = 1117ev um/ps

E = Kv*Vz
x = x + D*Kv*Vz

xPost[ij]=xPre[ij]+D*Kv*VzPre[ij]
D=dx/dE=6.421 ("in concert with RF power of LL2")

LL2 has the same lens coefficient at LL1

	Important things to know

-We will need to create a phase space simulation that not only has the shape of the phase space
but and VERY IMPORTANTLY
has the data gathered from hitting the specimen in each point.

	Objectives
-Create a phase space simulator that simulates the phase space and collects data from hitting the specimen
in order to collect the data it needs to shatter
recombine the phase spaces at the end and collect the data
