# EELS-simulator
A simulator modeling the evolution and energy loss of the phase space of a high-intensity electron beam as it travels through an electron microscope with adaptive optics.

#Phase space manipulation
The electron beam is represented as a normal phase space distribution. The various processes that occur due to free expansion or lensing are represented and manipulations to the variables the describe the distribution. 
The current processes are simulated:
free expansion
lens manipulations
specimen shattering
analyzer manipulations
final spectrogram
