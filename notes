		Math Conversion
sigmaZ = hWidth;	the hWidth along the z axis
sigmaVz = hHeight;	the hHeight along the Vz axis
zetaZ = VzIntDist;	the distance between the two Vz intercepts				//I think since it is between z (distance) and Vz(relative difference in velocity)
tau = zIntDist;		the distance between the two z intercepts				//Its important to write z and Vz, instead of x and y
a = chirp;			the chirp. chirp = slope
b = b;				the relationship between the chirp, zIntDist, and VzIntDist. (b=a(tau/zeta)^2)
z = dist;			the distance from the origin-from the center of mass
Vz = vel;			the difference in velocity from center of mass

	Important things to know

-We will need to create a phase space simulation that not only has the shape of the phase space
but and VERY IMPORTANTLY
has the data gathered from hitting the specimen in each point.

	Objectives
-Create a phase space simulator that simulates the phase space and collects data from hitting the specimen
in order to collect the data it needs to shatter
recombine the phase spaces at the end and collect the data

	Time Table
Siemens Competition
Due September 19
-Things to do
Figure out shattering (secondary splitting)
Recenter center of mass individually for each phase space
Figure out data containment
Figure out how to recombine after shattering

	Michigan ISEF Qualification Fair 
Due March 15

LARGE PART NOT YET FIGURED OUT Figure out how to optimize the microscope through combinations of optics
Write an at most 18 pages (not including references) paper about our research
