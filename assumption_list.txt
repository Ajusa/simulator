**constant hWidth and zDist during splitting
	since an infinite amount of splitting is said to approximate the actual distribution, it follows that
	
	
		emmittance = hWidth * VzDist = hHeight * zDist
	
	The different split phase spaces probably don't equally contribute to the effective emmitance of the PS (equal emmitance), 
		if it did, that means the tips would have the same effective area as the middle.
